1. Task Management:
Task Creation and Modification: Users can create tasks specifying details such as deadlines, priorities, descriptions, etc. Tasks can be edited or updated through an interface, likely accessible via the task.php and update_status.php files.
Task Viewing: Users can view the tasks assigned to them or that they have created, through a dashboard interface provided by user_dashboard.php.
Status Updates: The application allows users to update the status of tasks (e.g., in progress, completed) using functionalities likely contained within update_status.php.
2. User Management:
User Registration: New users can register in the system using register.php, which likely includes form inputs for name, email, password, and perhaps roles if the system supports different user levels (e.g., admin, regular user).
User Authentication: The system manages user login processes with user_login.php, ensuring that user credentials are checked before granting access to the system.
User Logout: Ensures users can securely log out of the system, with session data being cleared to prevent unauthorized access, facilitated by logout.php.
3. Administrative Functions:
User and Task Administration: Admin-level users can manage other user accounts and their tasks, which are functionalities likely housed in the admin/ directory. This may include setting task assignments, changing user roles, or managing permissions.
4. Leave Management:
Leave Requests: The system seems to include functionality for managing leave requests through leaveForm.php, where users can submit requests for leaves.
Leave Status Checking: Users can check the status of their leave requests using leave_status.php, which might show pending approvals, rejected, or approved leaves.
5. Reporting and Documentation:
Reports and System Diagrams: Located in the report and diagrams/ directory, these files likely include documentation about the system's architecture, flow diagrams, and possibly reports on user activity or task statistics.
6. Responsive Web Design:
Bootstrap Framework: Utilizing Bootstrap files from the bootstrap/ directory ensures that the application is responsive and can function effectively across various devices and screen sizes.
7. Database Interaction:
MySQL Database Usage: All user data, task details, and possibly leave records are stored in a MySQL database, with scripts for setting up and managing these located in the database/ directory.
Conclusion
This Task Management System is designed to streamline the organization and monitoring of tasks, enhancing productivity and ensuring efficient management of work within an organization.
